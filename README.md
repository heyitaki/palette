# Palette
Palette is a graph visualization platform that allows users to display network-based data as a series of nodes and links. This is a re-write of the work I was doing at [Archer](https://archerimpact.com/) and [Simplata](https://www.simplata.io/), utilizing D3 v4 and Typescript. Any contributions are welcome!

Check out a demo [here](https://akshath.me/palette/).

## To-do
### Large tasks
- Create sidebar with search functionality
- Expose graph as a React component
- Ensure multiple graphs can co-exist on the same page and work as intended at sizes that are smaller than the containing window/viewport
- Allow user to add new nodes to the graph
- Persist changes

### Small tasks/bugs
- Expose grid functionality and allow nodes to snap to lines/corners
- If a node is selected, bring it and its incoming/outgoing links to the front of their respective containers in the DOM
